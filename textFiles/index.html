            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer that has worked primarily  on connecting online retail stores 
                with any number of external applications such as connecting their website with an order 
                management system or web based financial apps. I enjoy this field because of my passion 
                toward learning new skills, and online retailers specifically are very aggressive towards
                making their website as leading edge as possible which requires me to constantly learn 
                new skills to make that possible. <br>
                When I am not working, I can usually be found outside somewhere in my home state of Colorado. Because of 
                my passion for learning new skills, I spend a lot of my time trying almost any outdoor recreational activity 
                that I can, whether it be fishing, disc golf, rafting, hockey, softball, or any number of activities that Colorado
                has to offer. </p>
